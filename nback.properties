# INTERACTIVE TIMED PROPERTIES
# The following properties apply to an nback task which is synchronised both 
# with mouse clicks, and with a timer.

# How many mouse clicks before a segment is finished.
# When it is finished, it is either resynchronised with the mouse clicks, or
# a block of focus elements are shown.
interactiveTimed.ticksPerSegment=10

# How many numbers to show per segment, before either resyncing or focusing.
interactiveTimed.numbersPerSegment=20

# How many milliseconds between ticks.
# This is used in addition to ticksPerSegment and numbersPerSegment to decide 
# how long between each number in a segment.
interactiveTimed.timePerTick=3000

# How many segments to show before the task is finished.
interactiveTimed.totalSegments=4


# INTERFACE PROPERTIES
# The following properties define how to present the task.
# It includes things like colours and font sizes.
# If you don't understand the colour notation, you can just go to a simple 
# colour picker tool and copy the value from there 
# (http://www.google.com.au/search?q=online+colour+picker)
# The value you are looking for is the Hex/Hexadecimal value (six charactres
# prepended by a # or a 0x).
